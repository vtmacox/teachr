## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to better interface with data analysts by learning basic data analysis skills
- Learn how to learn to use **R** and **RStudio**

## Analyzing Data

- Understanding how data are read in and manipulated can help you be a better researcher
    - How to create databases
    - How new variables are created
    - Knowing which variables are which type
    - Knowing which analyses you can run based on the type of data you have

### Data analysis programs

## About **R**

**R** is an open source, object oriented "language and environment for statistical computing and graphics".

www.r-project.org

**R** is popular because:
- It's free
- It has a broad support network where users can ask and answer questions
- It is highly adaptable through the use of packages

### Parts of the R graphic user interface

- Console 
- Editor
- Graphics Device

### **R** user interface

## **RStudio**

The basic **R** GUI is not optimized for users

**RStudio** is a separate integrated development environment that enhances the usability of R in several ways

Basic enhancements from R studio include:

  - Easier navigation of multiple scripts, plots, packages, and global environment
  - Code completion
  - Color coding of code
  - Easier debugging
  
The most useful elements of R studio include:

- Projects (grouping all related R files and workspaces together)

- Version control (through Git or other service)

- Shiny app (interactive controls and figures)

- Markdown (R Markdown, R Presentations, R HTML, etc.)

## Objects in **R**

Almost anything can be stored as an object in **R**.  Here, we save the operation of `1 + 1` to an object called `x` and then print that object. **NOTE:** **R** is case sensitive so an object called `x` is different than an object called `X`.

```{r r_object, echo=TRUE}

x <- 1 + 1
x

```

The `<-` symbol tells **R** you want to assign whatever is on the right of the sybol to the object on the left of the symbol.  In this example, we are assigning the value of `1 + 1` to the object `x`.  An important point is that **R** is evaluating the expression `1 + 1` and storing the value of the expression.  It doesn't actually store `1 + 1`.  Also, by default, **R** doesn't display objects unless explicitly requested.   


### Your first object in **R**

Write the R code required to add two plus two and store it as an object called `y` and print the object:

```{r exercise1, exercise=TRUE}
# Create and object that stores the value of 2 + 2 and save it as an object called y
# Don't forget to print the object too

```

```{r exercise1-solution}
y <- 2 + 2
y
```


### More obejcts

Obejects can take on many complicated values.  They can be characters:

```{r}
char_ob <- "Values that are characters in R are called strings."
char_ob
```

They can contain multiple values.  If you have multiple values, compbine them by using the `c()` function.  For example:

```{r}
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers
```


Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Reading in data

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
